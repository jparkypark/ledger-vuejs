# ledger-vuejs

> A Vue.js project

## Prompt

You have been tasked with writing the world’s greatest banking ledger.

Please code a solution that can perform the following workflows through a console application (accessed via the command line) as well as through a web page. They don’t have to run at the same time, but if you would like to do that, feel free!

- Create a new account
- Login
- Record a deposit
- Record a withdrawal
- Check balance
- See transaction history
- Log out

Please use a temporary memory store (local cache) instead of creating an actual database.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
